                          **TuxGuitar**

**Welcome to the new home of TuxGuitar, the free guitar tablature editor.**

TuxGuitar was written by Julián Gabriel Casadesús and maintained by him for a very long time.
At the end of 2022, the former TuxGuitar websites disappeared and the development in the [SourceForge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/) stalled.
After unsuccessful attempts to contact Julián, some TuxGuitar enthusiasts initiated a new [TuxGuitar repository](https://github.com/helge17/tuxguitar/) on Github.
