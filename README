If you see an error like "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError", you will need to replace your swt shared library files and jar 
packages compiled for your system. TuxGuitar comes with SWT for linux-x86, linux-x86_64, mac and win32-x86. make sure download 
the correct file. if you need another version, download your SWT and replace in lib folder.             
If you don't have SWT installed in one of this locations: /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib or TuxGuitar/lib.  You will need to 
add its path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CLASSPATH environment vars.

$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your_swt_library_folder/
$export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/your_swt_library_folder/swt.jar

    * UNSUPPORTED CLASS VERSION:

java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError. This means that your JVM is not compatible with the JVM used to create the binaries.  
If you see a message like this, you will need to rebuild TuxGuitar from sources.

    * FAILDED TO LOAD PLUGINS:

on Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0. if you have installed more than one JVM in your system, you can use one of these 
environment vars:  JAVA or JAVA_HOME to run TuxGuitar with a specified JVM.
